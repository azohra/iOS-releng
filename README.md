# Reddit Article iOS Code Challenge

#### Introduction

The data driving this app is from  <https://www.reddit.com/r/swift.json>. The current design and structure of this app is one of many solutions, and uses the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture and runs on any simulator version. However the developer have made the mistake of writing code without testing, and better yet test automation. How will this software product ever become competitive without continous integration (CI) and delivery? Please rescue them!

#### Instructions

Here is their wishlist: 

1. Give this project a CI pipeline so the team can be more productive. Use [Fastlane](https://fastlane.tools/) and [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) or [Bitrise](https://www.bitrise.io/) as integral pieces of your pipeline. Your project should be a forked of this repo and live on Github and be set up for continuous integration - running builds and automated test on every pull request. It should be easy for other developers to add to the code base.

2. If you find any bug/usability issues, please fix them and highlight them to the team as part of your submission.

3. Add as much or as little test coverage (using XCTest / XCUITest) as you feel is necessary for the scope of your application. This can include networking tests, mock data, data integrity, and anything else that you feel will add value. Basically, cover as much as you can with tests that are relevant â€“ don't just add tests for the sake of writing code.
